Although intelligent text search algorithms are widely available these days, documents are still hard to find in many cases. It is usually hard to find useful information in help systems and manual pages, even when required information exists in the documents.
Searches fail mainly because of the "vocabulary problem," where users cannot find the right search keyword. When a user wants to "remove a file," and there is a manual entry for "deleting a file," users may not be able to know how to remove a file until he finds the right keyword "delete" for the search.
To solve the problem, various query expansion techniques are widely used on the Web. When a user types "remove" in the search box, the system automatically expands the keyword and suggests using "remove/delete" instead. Query expansion works effectively for simple cases, but it does not work well when the concept in the users' mind is very different from the text in the manual document. For example, if a user wants to "clean up the desktop," he cannot find an appropriate manual entry that only describes how to "delete icons" or "align icons" on the desktop.

We propose a new approach "document expansion" for finding help documents and manual entries. We provide flexible explanations for each document using regular expression patterns. For the above example, we give an expression like '(delete|remove) (a file|data)' and use the expanded text like 'delete a file', 'remove data' for keyword search. Also, a pattern like '(delete|remove) #{file}' is expanded to 'delete Makefile', 'delete search.c', etc. depending on the existing files, so that a user can enter 'del ma' to get 'delete Makefile' and immediately execute it.
We have been using this document expansion technique called ExpandHelp for several years, and the system is working on various commercial Web services. In this paper, we describe the idea and implementation of ExpandHelp and show how it works in the wild.
